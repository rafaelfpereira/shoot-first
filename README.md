  - adding a tutorial/instructions modal at the beginning
  - adding a replay button
  - adding a counter for the number of rounds won under each player
  - fixing a bug where the theme won't play most of the time
  - fixing a bug where there is a delay between the keypress and the shot sound
  
### MAYBE LIST:
  - adding an option for the players to input
  - changing the visuals to a han solo shot first style game
